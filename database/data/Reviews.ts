    body: 'Not a salad type of girl, but this place makes me act like one hehe. Love the salad bar, one of my favorite items here is the raisin nut broccoli mix. Adds just the right amount of sweetness to my salad. The balsamic dressing is yum as well. Get your money\'s worth by piling as much salad you can on that plate! \n\nChicken noodle soup is the only soup that\'s good here imo. Add a bit of black pepper and it tastes exactly like my mom\'s chicken soup. The broth is never too salty or bland unlike the other soups. Not a fan of the chicken inside the soup though, because its dry. The pastas and macaroni are pretty bad. Unless you enjoy bland overcooked/mushy pasta.\n\nI like to end my meal with the mini muffins. They\'re always refilled constantly therefore hot and delicious. Even the gluten free ones. The blueberry ones seems to be everybody\'s favorite. The top crust on these muffins are beyond yummy and addicting.\n\nBest time to eat is before 6pm on weekends. The place tends to get super crowded real quick.',

The service was great and our server did the best job he can do.\n\rThe food was good I ordered the Talas it just reminded me of chicken pot pie. My dad and sister ordered the kabobs. My dad and sister liked their food as well.\n\rThe ambience is nice and small. Not that many seats available and there is a small bar in the back. There\'s street parking.\n\rI would come back and try out the other food on the menu as well.',

Get there at 8 and the host says he\'ll take us to the bar until our table is available.\n\rLong story short at 8:45 we decided to eat at the bar.  Very disappointed as host never came back, another worker saw we were looking around to see what the status was so saud should be only a few more minutes.  Bartender ended up taking care of us.\n\rYou\'d think an apology from the host, or a complementary drink or item of final bill could have been offered as a compensation for inconvenience and bad customer service.  But none received.\n\rThe food was good, very good but not amazing.  Unfortunately this first impression won\'t be taking us back.',

I was looking for an open studio option since I already have experience with wheel throwing and this is the only pottery studio in SF that offers it. During my time at SMAart Gallery & Studio I\'ve been really impressed by how dedicated the instructors were to their craft through observation, how neat the studio was and also how often they fired their kilns. The kilns are fired whenever the shelves fill up so the timing varies but Steve is very communicative about this.',
